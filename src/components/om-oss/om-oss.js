                    <p>
                    We are a student association at Link√∂ping University devoted to the exploration, 
                    research and continuous learning of artificial intelligence. We cultivate connections with both 
                    industry and academia through networking events, educational lectures, workshops and research projects.
                     We serve as a platform for members and partners to network, build professional relationships, and share knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                    We are committed to organizing events that bridge the gap between students and the spheres of industry and academia. 
                    Through workshops, seminars, lectures and collaborative projects, we seek to broaden the AI and machine learning knowledge 
                    base of our student body, and to provide a clear view of potential career paths in these fields. The society is also meant to be a 
                    platform for engaged and ambitious students to garner internships or research opportunities.
